 ## 	:runner: Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to set up and run the Auto Trading Script:

 **1-Configuration**: Create a .env file in the root directory and populate it with the following environment variables:

```bash
 NOBITEX_API = XXXXXXXXXXXX
 KAVEH_API = XXXXXXXXXX
 BALE_BOT_TOKEN = XXXXXXXX
 TRADING = 1  
```
 TRADING = 1 => Enables automated trading<br/>
 TRADING = 0 => Disables automated trading 

**2-Running the Script**: Start the development server by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node index
```
You can start editing the script by modifying `index.ts`. 

**3-Customization**: Feel free to delve into the index.ts file to modify and enhance the trading strategy according to your preferences.
